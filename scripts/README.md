1. Save the script to a file, for example `adb_auto_connect.ps1`.

2. Open PowerShell as Administrator.

3. Ensure that the execution policy allows running scripts. You can change the execution policy with:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```

4. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved:
   ```powershell
   cd path\to\script\directory
   ```

5. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   .\adb_auto_connect.ps1
   ```
