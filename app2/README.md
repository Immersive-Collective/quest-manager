## Code Highlights

### Device Discovery
Automatically discovers and connects to devices over TCP/IP:
```javascript
function refreshDeviceConnections() {
    getDevices((devices) => {
        devices.forEach(device => {
            if (!connectedDevices.has(device.id)) {
                connectDeviceOverTCP(device.id);
            }
        });
    });
}
```

### File Synchronization
Downloads today's video files from the device:
```javascript
app.post('/sync', async (req, res) => {
    // Implementation for synchronizing files
